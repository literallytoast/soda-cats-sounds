# soda-cats-sounds
Mod for lethal company, that replaces baboon hawk screeches, laughs, and other sounds in the game with different sounds from the [Soda Cats video](https://youtu.be/RWeHA8CgHbo).

## Installation
Download the releases from the *Releases* tab\
Unzip the .zip file  
Place in your LethalCompany/BepInEx/plugins folder<br/>
Done!

### Installing with Thunderstore...  
I unfortunately have never used Thunderstore. So, I can't necessarily say how to use it. However, I'm sure it would be easy once the mod is uploaded there!
